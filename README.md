# Roadie

## Description
A social media app where travelers can share their adventures!

## Installation
Once you have Roadie in your local files, run 'npm i' from the command line to install all dependencies. From there you can use 'npm run develop' to concurrently run the server and the client in order to use the application.

## Usage
The primary purpose of this application is to allow users to share and communicate with others who love to travel. When first loading the application, the user is taken to a home page where they can view other users' posts without logging in. Once the user has signed up or logged in, they can create a travel log post. 

Posts must include the trip location, the estimated cost of the trip, and a summary of the user's experience. Users also have the option to include the heritages in the place they visited, how accessible it was, an image from their trip, as well as any additional comments they wish to include. 

Logged in users also have the option of commenting on posts to share their response. The user can edit or delete any of their own posts or comments.

A user may also add other users to their friends list, and this friends list appears on their profile page along with their own posts. The names included in the friends list act as links that direct you to that user's profile page.
